  <h1>Extra Life API</h1>
  <p>Extra Life API wrapper for JavaScript in the browser and Node.js.</p>
</div>

## Installation

You can install the `extra-life` module via `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm i extra-life
yarn add extra-life
```

## About

This module is multi-platform and can be used in Node.js scripts or within the browser. The
module has ZERO dependencies and will natively use the `https` built-in in Node or `fetch`
in the browser. If you are using this in a browser that doesn't natively incorporate `fetch`,
you can [polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch).

The interfaces exposed are based off of the
[DonorDrive Public API spec](https://github.com/DonorDrive/PublicAPI).

## Sample Usage

### Node.js

In Node, it is as simple as requiring the module and using it.

```js
const extraLife = require('extra-life');
extraLife.getTeam(45209).then(console.log);
```

### Browser

There are two ways to use this module in the browser. The first way is to import it into your
project that will be transpiled.

```js
import { getTeam } from 'extra-life';
getTeam(45209).then(console.log);
```

The second way is to include the raw `extra-life.js` file from this package directly in your HTML
and then access the `extraLife` variable to make your API calls.

```html
<script src="path/to/extra-life.js"></script>
<script>
extraLife.getTeam(45209).then(console.log);
</script>
```

## API

All methods defined below return
[ES6 Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
You can use simple `.then()` notation or `async`/`await`, depending on your preference.

The payload returned for each method will be in accordance with the
[DonorDrive documentation](https://github.com/DonorDrive/PublicAPI/tree/master/docs/1.0).
The few methods that optionally take a `limit` and a `page` will return a response object
with a `totalRecords` count and the results in a `records` array:

```js
{
  totalRecords: 100,
  records: [...]
}
```

### Participants

Each method here, with the exception of `getParticipants`, requires a `participantId`. You can
get a `participantId` from the results of `getParticipant`, or from the URL of a participant
on the Extra Life website.

The URL will look like: `https://extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.participant&participantID=[PARTICIPANT ID HERE]`
